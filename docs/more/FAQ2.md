#### Why are my file transfers going through different routers?
To scale our ability to provide high speed and high bandwidth file transfers, we have disabled transfer on the message router (bucket1.demonbucket.com) and added transfer routers to the message router.

The message router goes through the router list in round robin, grabbing the first available data router.
