Demonsaw provides you with a way to create your own network or join a public Demonsaw network so that you can share and communicate securely.\n\n\nDemonsaw 2 and Demonsaw 3 are not compatible with each other, they connect to competely different networks.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFirst thing first! You need to \ndownload Demonsaw\n!\n\n\nDemonsaw is provided without installers, as a stand-alone application so that it can be run from or stashed anywhere you want. Just download the version you need for your operating system, extract it somewhere, and launch Demonsaw.\n\n\nWant an Installer?\n\n\nThe community (dekka) has provided a Linux repository for Debian and Ubuntu, and also has rpm packages for Fedora/Redhat.\n\n\nWant to learn more? Check out \nrepo.dsrouters.com\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThis section will be a rough overview of how Demonsaw works, how it is designed to protect you, and will hopefully take some of the confusion out of the network.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nClients do not communicate with clients, Demonsaw is not peer to peer. \n\n\nAll client communication goes through message routers and data routers.\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to sniff your local traffic and peer into the Demonsaw communication, you'd see TCP traffic that looks just like HTTP web traffic... but with encrypted payloads. Clients can pass user-agent strings, making them appear more like a web browser. Demonsaw routers can listen on any port you want, including 80 and 8080, and can even redirect actual web browsers to another website with a 301 permanent redirect.\n\n\nIn essence, Demonsaw clients and routers are both behaving as both an HTTP server and a client, allowing them to send messages and data back and forth all while looking like normal web traffic.\n\n\nDownloads\n\n\nAnother big change in Demonsaw 3 is the way downloads are performed. Below is a list of the changes.\n\n\n\n\nFile sharding; file transfers are broken into chunks and transferred across multiple data routers instead of just one.\n\n\nMulti-threaded file transfer; acts as a method for throttling transfer but allows you to use all your upload bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\nCrypto\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nYou specify the security of the crypto handshake, you control your level of protection.\n\n\nAt minimum, your communication is wrapped in two layers of crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonsaw allows you to choose your own level of security through cryptography, both through the first handshake with a router and through the use of groups setup with social cryptography. Demonsaw uses Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to connect securely, but allows you to define the prime size, cipher, key size, hash type, salt, and how many iterations.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of the encrypted connection to a Demonsaw router, a second layer is added for the public group.\n\n\nIf you want to connect to a public router but be hidden from the public group, you can add crypto layers through the additions of groups. Unlike the router crypto settings, you also get to define a file or passphrase as the source of entropy, allowing for extra secure cryptographic layers. Additionally, you can add as many layers as you want.\n\n\n\nDemonsaw Overview (Slides)",

You can now save your themes wherever you'd like without having to name it demonsaw.css or put it in the root directory of your demonsaw binary. \n\n\nTo select, apply, or reset your theme:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the options tab (the gear icon)\n\n\nScroll to the bottom of the options to the theme settings\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for Files\n\n\nThe search in Demonsaw 3 is very basic. If you'd like to search for Van Halen and only want .mp3 files then you will search for \"Van Halen mp3\" in quotes.\n\n\nSearches are also ordered based of the accuracy of the results + the highest shared/swarmed files. This is called the search \"weight\" and is represented graphically with cicles on the left side of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Message Routers\n\n\nSlightly different from Demonsaw 2, you are now able to add multiple message routers into Demonsaw but you can only select one at a time. When you create a new client with the wizard the public Demonsaw router will be added for you.\n\n\nAdd a message router:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Message Router tab in the center of Demonsaw \n\n\nClick the add button \n at the top right of the Message Router pane\n\n\nFill out the connection details and click the checkbox to enable it\n\n\n\n\nEdit an existing message router:\n\n\n\n\nSimply double-click the specific setting on an existing message router that you'd like to change\n\n\nClick the lightning icon \n at the top right of the Message Router pane to apply the settings\n\n\n\n\nMessage Router Groups\n\n\nAnother new addition to Demonsaw 3 is the ability to add additional cryptographic layers to the communication between routers with the use of router groups, these groups can also be used in place of router passphrases to prevent access to unauthorized routers and individuals.\n\n\nAdd a message router group:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Message Router tab in the center of Demonsaw \n\n\nSelect a router from the \nMessage Router section\n then click the add button \n at the top right of the \nMessage Router Group\n pane\n\n\nFill out the group settings to be as secure as you want or fill them in to match an existing group.\n\n\nClick the lightning icon \n at the top right of the \nMessage Router Group\n section to apply the settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Transfer Routers\n\n\nA new feature added to Demonsaw 3 is way you manage transfer (data) routers. When you connect to a message router it sends you a list of the transfer routers it uses, you can find these under the transfer router tab. This allows you to uncheck transfer routers you don't trust and add transfer routers that only you and your friends know about. Additionally, you can only transfer files with individuals that have a common transfer router enabled.\n\n\nTo add a transfer router:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Transfer Router tab in the center of Demonsaw \n\n\nClick the add button \n at the top right of the Transfer Router pane\n\n\nFill out the connection details and click the checkbox to enable it\n\n\n\n\nTo disable a transfer router:\n\n\n\n\nSimply uncheck the transfer routers you wish to disable\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Router Groups\n\n\nAnother new addition to Demonsaw 3 is the ability to add additional cryptographic layers to the communication between routers with the use of router groups, these groups can also be used in place of router passphrases to prevent access to unauthorized routers and individuals.\n\n\nAdd a transfer router group:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Transfer Router tab in the center of Demonsaw \n\n\nSelect a router from the \nTransfer Router section\n then click the add button \n at the top right of the \nTransfer Router Group\n pane\n\n\nFill out the group settings to be as secure as you want or fill them in to match an existing group.\n\n\nClick the lightning icon \n at the top right of the \nTransfer Router Group\n section to apply the settings",

We chose to document the setup for a Linux host because it is more common to have a headless client or router on a Linux host than on a Windows host.\n\n\nDownload Demonsaw\n\n\nDemonsaw has builds for multiple operating systems, for Linux you have the \nDebian\n build the \nUbuntu\n build and the \nRaspian\n build. Choose the version that you need for your specific Linux distro and download it.\n\n\nExtract \n Verify\n\n\nYou can extract Demonsaw and run it from wherever you want. If you're running a Demonsaw client off of a headless server it's perfectly fine to put the Demonsaw folder under your home directory. On a desktop Linux Debian distro you might want to put it somewhere better, I like /opt/demonsaw/ so that is what I'll show how to do.\n\n\nsudo mkdir /opt/demonsaw\nsudo tar xzf demonsaw.tar.gz -C /opt/demonsaw/\n\n\n\nThe above command extracts far more than you need for a headless router/client, if you want you can just extract 'demonsaw_cli' with \ntar -zxcf demonsaw_cli\n, this is also a good way to update demonsaw without over-writing your toml.\n\n\nNow you need to ensure that the permissions for the /opt/demonsaw/ folder are for your user, in the example our user is named joe.\n\n\nsudo chown -R joe /opt/demonsaw\n\n\n\nOne more important thing to verify is that demonsaw_cli has execute permissions, because sometimes mistakes are made.\n\n\nsudo chmod +x /opt/demonsaw/demonsaw_cli\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to launch demonsaw but you'll be missing the demonsaw.toml configuration, currently the demonsaw_cli will not automatically create this file because it is for a headless client.\n\n\nSetup your demonsaw config file\n\n\nThe easiest way to setup the demonsaw config file is to use the GUI to create the setup you want; You can do it from any operating system as the toml is basically the same, just drop the demonsaw GUI binary somewhere like your desktop and run it, add a client and change all the settings to suit your needs, then save the toml and move it over the the machine running the headless client.\n\n\nIf you're in a rush or don't want to fool around with the GUI, below are links to demonsaw config file examples that you can wget from your host and edit.\n\n\ntoml examples\n\n\n\n\nHeadless client\n\n\nHeadless client w/ group\n\n\n\n\nWith the above example toml file you will need to set the client name, the router to connect to, and the paths and files you would like to share.\n\n\nLaunch \n Test\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to launch \ndemonsaw_cli\n from the command line, press \nC\n to see the status of the client/s. It will take a few seconds of waiting, but it should land on success if everything worked, you should see your clients connected to the router now.\n\n\nStartup Scripts\n\n\nYou're now running your own Demonsaw headless client, you probably have it on a VPS somewhere to host files and won't always be able to ssh in to restart demonsaw_cli should it have some issues, or you might not want to have to ssh in just to start demonsaw_cli everytime the server is rebooted; Startup scripts.\nThere are a few ways to do this, I recommend using \nDaniel Stinebaugh's startup script\n, but you can start it how ever you would like, including crontab or init scripts.\n\n\nConsiderations\n\n\nSo you have a working Demonsaw client now, what is next? The cli has a few options for things such as refreshing so that files added to the share are now visible to demonsaw, restart to enable changes to the client configuration, etc.\n\n\nIf you are hosting the headless client on a VPS, you should also think about bandwidth usage as well as the security of your VPS. If your VPS is compromised then some hackers could have the credentials to monitor any secret groups that client was connected to.",

If you're reading this and have a question you believe should be on here, please let us know in Demonsaw chat.\n\n\n\n\nThe Client\n\n\nHow am I secure?\n\n\nYou get to pick the level of protection connecting to the message router under the security tab. Even connecting to the public group, you will always have at least one layer of crypto.\n\n\nHow am I anonymous?\n\n\nDemonsaw uses routers to handle all data and communications so that clients never have direct contact, preventing clients from identifying clients. That said, the machines running the routers can see the IP addresses, but it is very difficult to correlate a client to an IP, using a private group will prevent anyone from correlating your IP with a client on the network.\n\n\nWhat are groups?\n\n\nGroups allow you to add layers of crypto to your connection to further protect your communications, but groups also isolate you from the public group; \n\n\nYou can use groups like an especially secure channel on top of the router, where you can communicate and share with a group of friends or create a group for making files available for yourself when you are away from home.\n\n\nWhy do I see myself in browse?\n\n\nThis is by design. So that you are able to see your client is working, you can see yourself in the client list and browse (if you're sharing).\n\n\nWhy is there an envelope icon next to a message in chat?\n\n\nThis is how Private Messages (PM) are displayed, it is shown in public chat so that you know a message has come through. To open the message you can double-click the sender name or right-click the message and choose \"Message\".\n\n\n\n\nThe Router\n\n\nWhat role does the router play?\n\n\nMessage routers have several settings allowing you to enable/disable public group, messaging, data transfer, search, and browse. These settings allow you to define what a router supports and how you use it. If you want you can have a message only router and attach data routers to it (like the demonbucket network).\n\n\nWhat type of information does the router store?\n\n\nThe Demonsaw router doesn't log or save any data, and cannot save any data. It reads the configuration file, it relays messages and data across the network, but nothing is ever written to disk.\n\n\n\n\nThe Network\n\n\nThe network is currently hosted and managed by Demonsaw LLC but we are open to adding community provided transfer routers to the mix since clients have the option to deselect routers they don't trust.\n\n\nThe below are a few questions and answers regarding this network and demonsaw networking in general.\n\n\nWhat is router.demonsaw.com?\n\n\nThis is the Demonsaw public message router, where messages, browse, and search is performed. It should be viewed as a sample network to show off how Demonsaw works, how you can use Demonsaw on your network, and to see how well Demonsaw can scale.\n\n\nWhy are my file transfers going through different routers?\n\n\nTo scale our ability to provide high speed and high bandwidth file transfers, we have disabled transfer on the message router (router.demonsaw.com) and added transfer routers to the message router. Additionally, Demonsaw 3 distributes each file transfer across multiple transfer routers for speed and extra anonymity (this is called sharding).",
