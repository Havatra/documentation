Demonsaw provides you with a way to create your own network or join a public Demonsaw network so that you can share and communicate securely.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFirst thing first! You need to \ndownload Demonsaw\n!\n\n\nDemonsaw is provided without installers, as a stand-alone application so that it can be run from or stashed anywhere you want. Just download the version you need for your operating system, extract it somewhere, and launch Demonsaw.\n\n\nWant an Installer?\n\n\nThe community (dekka) has provided a Linux repository for Debian and Ubuntu, and also has rpm packages for Fedora/Redhat.\n\n\nWant to learn more? Check out \nrepo.dsrouters.com\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThis section will be a rough overview of how Demonsaw works, how it is designed to protect you, and will hopefully take some of the confusion out of the network.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nClients do not communicate with clients, Demonsaw is not peer to peer. \n\n\nAll client communication goes through message routers and data routers.\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to sniff your local traffic and peer into the Demonsaw communication, you'd see TCP traffic that looks just like HTTP web traffic... but with encrypted payloads. Clients can pass user-agent strings, making them appear more like a web browser. Demonsaw routers can listen on any port you want, including 80 and 8080, and can even redirect actual web browsers to another website with a 301 permanent redirect.\n\n\nIn essence, Demonsaw clients and routers are both behaving as both an HTTP server and a client, allowing them to send messages and data back and forth all while looking like normal web traffic.\n\n\nCrypto\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nYou specify the security of the crypto handshake, you control your level of protection.\n\n\nAt minimum, your communication is wrapped in two layers of crypto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonsaw allows you to choose your own level of security through cryptography, both through the first handshake with a router and through the use of groups setup with social cryptography. Demonsaw uses Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to connect securely, but allows you to define the prime size, cipher, key size, hash type, salt, and how many iterations.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of the encrypted connection to a Demonsaw router, a second layer is added for the public group.\n\n\nIf you want to connect to a public router but be hidden from the public group, you can add crypto layers through the additions of groups.

We chose to document the setup for a Linux host because it is more common to have a headless client or router on a Linux host than on a Windows host.\n\n\nDownload Demonsaw\n\n\nDemonsaw has builds for multiple operating systems, for Linux you have the \nDebian\n build the \nUbuntu\n build and the \nRaspian\n build. Choose the version that you need for your specific Linux distro and download it.\n\n\nExtract \n Verify\n\n\nYou can extract Demonsaw and run it from wherever you want. If you're running a Demonsaw client off of a headless server it's perfectly fine to put the Demonsaw folder under your home directory. On a desktop Linux Debian distro you might want to put it somewhere better, I like /opt/demonsaw/ so that is what I'll show how to do.\n\n\nsudo mkdir /opt/demonsaw\nsudo tar xzf demonsaw.tar.gz -C /opt/demonsaw/\n\n\n\nThe above command extracts far more than you need for a headless router/client, if you want you can just extract 'demonsaw_cli' with \ntar -zxcf demonsaw_cli\n, this is also a good way to update demonsaw without over-writing your toml.\n\n\nNow you need to ensure that the permissions for the /opt/demonsaw/ folder are for your user, in the example our user is named joe.\n\n\nsudo chown -R joe /opt/demonsaw\n\n\n\nOne more important thing to verify is that demonsaw_cli has execute permissions, because sometimes mistakes are made.\n\n\nsudo chmod +x /opt/demonsaw/demonsaw_cli\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to launch demonsaw but you'll be missing the demonsaw.toml configuration, currently the demonsaw_cli will not automatically create this file because it is for a headless client.\n\n\nSetup your demonsaw config file\n\n\nThe easiest way to setup the demonsaw config file is to use the GUI to create the setup you want; You can do it from any operating system as the toml is basically the same, just drop the demonsaw GUI binary somewhere like your desktop and run it, add a client and change all the settings to suit your needs, then save the toml and move it over the the machine running the headless client.\n\n\nIf you're in a rush or don't want to fool around with the GUI, below are links to demonsaw config file examples that you can wget from your host and edit.\n\n\ntoml examples\n\n\n\n\nHeadless client\n\n\nHeadless client w/ group\n\n\n\n\nWith the above example toml file you will need to set the client name, the router to connect to, and the paths and files you would like to share.\n\n\nLaunch \n Test\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to launch \ndemonsaw_cli\n from the command line, press \nC\n to see the status of the client/s. It will take a few seconds of waiting, but it should land on success if everything worked, you should see your clients connected to the router now.\n\n\nStartup Scripts\n\n\nYou're now running your own Demonsaw headless client, you probably have it on a VPS somewhere to host files and won't always be able to ssh in to restart demonsaw_cli should it have some issues, or you might not want to have to ssh in just to start demonsaw_cli everytime the server is rebooted; Startup scripts.\nThere are a few ways to do this, I recommend using \nDaniel Stinebaugh's startup script\n, but you can start it how ever you would like, including crontab or init scripts.\n\n\nConsiderations\n\n\nSo you have a working Demonsaw client now, what is next? The cli has a few options for things such as refreshing so that files added to the share are now visible to demonsaw, restart to enable changes to the client configuration, etc.\n\n\nIf you are hosting the headless client on a VPS, you should also think about bandwidth usage as well as the security of your VPS. If your VPS is compromised then some hackers could have the credentials to monitor any secret groups that client was connected to.",

Now you need to ensure that the permissions for the /opt/demonsaw/ folder are for your user, in the example our user is named joe.  sudo chown -R joe /opt/demonsaw  One more important thing to verify is that demonsaw_cli has execute permissions, because sometimes mistakes are made.  sudo chmod +x /opt/demonsaw/demonsaw_cli  You should now be able to launch demonsaw but you'll be missing the demonsaw.toml configuration, currently the demonsaw_cli will not automatically create this file because it is for a headless client.",

If you're reading this and have a question you believe should be on here, please let us know in Demonsaw chat.\n\n\n\n\nThe Client\n\n\nHow am I secure?\n\n\nYou get to pick the level of protection connecting to the message router under the security tab. Even connecting to the public group, you will always have at least one layer of crypto.\n\n\nHow am I anonymous?\n\n\nDemonsaw uses routers to handle all data and communications so that clients never have direct contact, preventing clients from identifying clients. That said, the machines running the routers can see the IP addresses, but it is very difficult to correlate a client to an IP, using a private group will prevent anyone from correlating your IP with a client on the network.\n\n\nWhat are groups?\n\n\nGroups allow you to add layers of crypto to your connection to further protect your communications as well as isolating you from the public group; You can use groups like an especially secure channel on top of the router, where you can communicate and share privately.\n\n\nWhy don't I see myself in browse?\n\n\nThis is by design. You will not see your own client in browse, your shared files in search, or your client in the message list.\n\n\n\n\nThe Router\n\n\nWhat role does the router play?\n\n\nMessage routers have several settings allowing you to enable/disable public group, messaging, data transfer, search, and browse. These settings allow you to define what a router supports and how you use it. If you want you can have a message only router and attach data routers to it (like the demonbucket network).\n\n\nWhat type of information does the router store?\n\n\nThe Demonsaw router doesn't log or save any data, and cannot save any data. It reads the configuration file, it relays messages and data across the network, but nothing is ever written to disk.\n\n\n\n\nThe Network (Official Public Router)\n\n\nThe network that Demonsaw connects to by default is the official Demonsaw public router. It is fully funded and provided by Eijah with a few community routers that were contributed to add bandwidth to the network. It is to show off how you can use Demonsaw and to test how well it can scale. The below are a few questions and answers regarding this network and demonsaw networking in general.\n\n\nWhat is router.demonsaw.com?\n\n\nThis is a sample network, the tutorial level, a public example of the type of network you can create with Demonsaw.\n\n\nWhy are my file transfers going through different routers?\n\n\nTo scale our ability to provide high speed and high bandwidth file transfers, we have disabled transfer on the message router (router.demonsaw.com) and added transfer routers to the message router. Some or possibly most of the transfer routers are contributed and operated by community members.\n\n\nHow does Demonsaw determine what data router I get?\n\n\nDemonsaw 'shards' file transfers, this means that file transfers are broken up and transferred through multiple transfer routers at once. To transfer a single file, depending on the size of the file, Demonsaw can transfer the file across anywhere between 1 to 8 transfer routers at once.",
