Demonsaw provides you with a way to create your own network or join a public Demonsaw network so that you can share and communicate securely.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFirst thing first! You need to \ndownload Demonsaw\n!\n\n\nDemonsaw is provided without installers, as a stand-alone application so that it can be run from or stashed anywhere you want. Just download the version you need for your operating system, extract it somewhere, and launch Demonsaw.\n\n\nWant an Installer?\n\n\nThe community (dekka) has provided a Linux repository for Debian and Ubuntu, and also has rpm packages for Fedora/Redhat.\n\n\nWant to learn more? Check out \nrepo.dsrouters.com\n\n\nHow it Works\n\n\nThis section will be a rough overview of how Demonsaw works, how it is designed to protect you, and will hopefully take some of the confusion out of the network.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nClients do not communicate with clients, Demonsaw is not peer to peer. \n\n\nAll client communication goes through message routers and data routers.\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to sniff your local traffic and peer into the Demonsaw communication, you'd see TCP traffic that looks just like HTTP web traffic... but with encrypted payloads. Clients can pass user-agent strings, making them appear more like a web browser. Demonsaw routers can listen on any port you want, including 80 and 8080, and can even redirect actual web browsers to another website with a 301 permanent redirect.\n\n\nIn essence, Demonsaw clients and routers are both behaving as both an HTTP server and a client, allowing them to send messages and data back and forth all while looking like normal web traffic.\n\n\nCrypto\n\n\nTL;DR;\n\n\n\n\nYou specify the security of the crypto handshake, you control your level of protection.\n\n\nAt minimum, your communication is wrapped in two layers of crypto.\n\n\n\n\nMore details are needed from Eijah\n\n\n\nThe Network\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup a Client\n\n\nClick 'Next' at the top right to continue.",
