# Demonsaw - Documentation

This repository is purely for the Demonsaw 3.0+ documentation only.

### What are we using?

Documentation is built with MkDocs which only requires python and python-pip module MkDocs. All that is necessary to contribute is to fork the documentation repository, install mkdocs on your system, and add any changes before submitting a pull request.


### Reporting site issues or incorrect information

Issue tracking has been enabled for this repository, please verify that the problem has not been reported and create an new [Issue](https://github.com/demonsaw/documentation/issues).


### Repository Access and Pull Requests

Since our first go at a community wiki/documentation project, we had a few trusted community members add too much incorrect information and content that could not be understood. For this reason we will be limiting write access to the [Demonsaw](https://github.com/demonsaw/) repositories.


Please feel free to fork and submit any pull requests, we'll respond back as quickly as possible.
